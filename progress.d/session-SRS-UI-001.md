=== SESSION SRS-UI-001 ===
Date: 2026-07-03
Feature: SRS-UI-001 — web dashboard: live performance, system health, latency, benchmark-relative metrics; ≤5s refresh (SYS-36 / NFR-P2)
Outcome: serialized (passes stays false — browser-automation demo + 30-paper baseline-load perf test are the deferred, operator-run flip evidence)

What I did:
- Built new top-layer package `python/atp_dashboard/` on the SRS-API-001 operator-interface runtime (did NOT add a second server):
  - `provider.py` — `DashboardMetricsProvider` Protocol + `ReadinessBackedProvider`. System health is the REAL `atp_readiness.ReadinessGate.as_dashboard_payload()` (cached, fail-safe). Every metric owned by a still-blocked feature (BT-004 P&L/Sharpe/etc., BT-005 benchmark, PERF-001 latency, MD-006/007 heartbeat) is an honest `{"value":null,"data_source":"deferred:<owner>"}` placeholder — never fabricated.
  - `publisher.py` — daemon ticker; registers the 3 SRS-UI-001-owned WS publishers (PNL/METRICS/HEARTBEAT) and publishes each at its atp_ws-declared cadence (≤ MAX_REFRESH_SECONDS=5); immediate first tick; clean bounded stop (no leaked thread).
  - `assets/{index.html,styles.css,app.js}` — self-contained "Mission Control" dashboard (no external CDN/fonts; SEC-002 posture). 4 panels + a signature refresh-latency pulse gauge that renders the client's OWN observed refresh latency vs the 5000 ms NFR-P2 budget (real, self-measured). Dark+light, reduced-motion, ARIA live, responsive. Deferred values render as honest dashed "—" with the owning-feature tag.
  - `server.py`/`__main__.py` — `mount_dashboard(runtime, provider)` (assets read once into a fixed path→bytes map — no path-injection surface) + blocking `serve()` entrypoint with SIGINT/SIGTERM clean shutdown; loopback bind via runtime.start's assert_bind_allowed.
- Added a minimal GENERIC seam to `python/atp_runtime/` (paired with the domain test — mandatory, atp_runtime ∈ SAFETY_PATH_RE): `register_meta_route` (JSON GET, rides existing meta_get; Dispatcher meta map is now a mutable dict) + `register_asset_routes`/`_asset_routes` + `LoopbackHTTPServer` trailing `asset_routes={}` + `_Handler` GET asset branch (exact-key lookup) + `_write_raw`. Stays vendor-agnostic — imports no consumer package (dependency_boundary clean).
- Did NOT touch atp_api.ROUTES or atp_ws channels (no OpenAPI/AsyncAPI snapshot churn).

What I tested (per step / layer):
- Step 1 (env): `./init.sh` builds worktree .venv/target (dev-deps installed manually — init.sh skips requirements-dev.txt; placeholder dev server 3000 was held by a stale PID, irrelevant to build).
- Step 2 (exercise): in-process + `python -m atp_dashboard` (port 39007) smoke — GET /dashboard→200 text/html, /dashboard/styles.css→text/css, /dashboard/app.js→application/javascript, /dashboard/api/system→200 JSON (health.data_source=live, real readiness), POST→404 read-only, WS SUBSCRIBE→first EVENT in ~1.0s (<5s), deferred field value=None (no fabrication), SIGTERM→clean shutdown (port released ~500ms).
- L1 unit `tests/unit/test_dashboard_{provider,publisher}.py`: shape==atp_ws contract, no-fabrication, cache, cadence≤5s, not-reentrant, no leaked thread, fail-safe health. PASS.
- L4 boundary `tests/boundary/test_dashboard_wiring.py`: real socket assets + snapshot + WS EVENT within time.monotonic()<5.0. PASS.
- L7 domain `tests/domain/test_dashboard_safety.py` (safety marker): read-only (POST/PUT/DELETE→404/405), kill-switch 428 guard unchanged, loopback/RFC1918-only bind refused for public hosts, publisher claims only owned channels, no deferred fabrication. PASS.
- L6 e2e `tests/e2e/test_dashboard_refresh.py` (gated ATP_RUN_E2E=1, Playwright importorskip): browser renders 4 panels + observed-refresh updates <5s. WRITTEN, not run solo (browsers absent; e2e forbidden in parallel).
- Full solo suite: `pytest -m "not integration and not e2e"` → 2857 passed, 10 skipped (cargo-gated), 12 deselected, 129 subtests. No regressions (existing operator-runtime L4/L7 still green).
- ruff check + ruff format --check: clean. mypy: atp_dashboard fully strict-clean; my atp_runtime additions add 0 new errors (fixed a real var-shadowing bytes/dict error); remaining type-arg errors are the pre-existing repo-wide bare-`dict` baseline (integrate skips mypy; run_ci mypy dies on that baseline, not my code).
- Architecture/contract checks: operator_interface_runtime, rest_api, websocket_api, architecture, dependency_boundary, cli, operator_workflow_surface, log_record — ALL PASS.

Critic verdicts:
  deterministic (critic_check.py --staged): APPROVE — no findings.
  judgment (adversarial_review.py, reviewer=claude-fallback — codex output unparseable, dispatcher failed over per design): APPROVE — no findings.

Resume / next:
- Classification serialized: operator flips passes:true via `verified-e2e` after (a) `playwright install chromium` + `ATP_RUN_E2E=1 pytest tests/e2e/test_dashboard_refresh.py`, and (b) the NFR-P2 ≤5s refresh perf run under the 1-live+30-paper docker stack (NFR-SC1). Serialized does NOT auto-unblock the dependent cluster (LOG-001, MD-002/003, BT-004/005, ERR-9, API-001, RES-001) — the flip does.
- When BT-004/BT-005/PERF-001/MD-006/MD-007 land: replace `ReadinessBackedProvider`'s deferred fields with those producers (the FIELD_OWNERS map documents each seam); the WS payload shapes + UI already match the atp_ws contract, so it's a provider swap, not a rebuild.

=== FOLLOW-UP (2026-07-04): per-channel refresh fix + re-review ===
- After main landed the adversarial_review.py envelope-unwrap fix (commit 3880988), re-ran the judgment pass against my diff (base 254fc26). With the fix, Codex's REAL verdict was readable (no longer "unparseable"→claude-fallback).
- Round 1 (codex): BLOCK (high, 0.9) — "Refresh SLA measured across any event, not each required metric group": the client used one `lastAnyEventAt` updated on ANY event, so a 1s PNL/HEARTBEAT tick could keep the gauge green while the 5s METRICS/benchmark panel was stale. REAL bug. FIXED in commit c2081ac: per-channel freshness (`lastChannelAt`), a 500ms `monitorFreshness` drives the gauge off the WORST required-channel staleness + marks each panel fresh/stale (a SILENT channel now goes stale); boundary test rewritten to subscribe-then-start-publisher and assert EACH required channel refreshes <5s + fast channels keep refreshing (>=2); gated e2e asserts each panel freshdot='fresh'.
- Round 2 (codex): BLOCK (high, 0.94) — "required metrics are deferred placeholders." This is NOT a defect: it is the inherent serialized scope (producers BT-004/005/PERF-001/MD-006/007 are blocked ON this feature; fixing would mean fabricating data — banned — or circular deps). Codex's own recommendation is "keep as a serialized skeleton only" and "do NOT flip to passing until browser+perf evidence" == the operator-approved serialized classification. **Operator-authorized override (AskUserQuestion, 2026-07-04): land the freshness fix `--mode serialized`; passes stays false.** Never faked an APPROVE.
- Full solo suite after fix: 2887 passed, 0 regressions. Deterministic critic APPROVE. app.js `node --check` OK, ruff clean.
